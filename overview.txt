idea: go from sheet music/MIDI file to guitar tab

problem: there are multiple ways to play one note on a guitar, so which one is the most ergonomic?
potential solution: use machine learning (probably NLP) with the sheet music as a 'language', and translate it to a new language, with styles that are more correct than others

tranining: create datasets of sheet music and guitar tabs for the same song, and train model on these
testing: give sheet music but not tab
